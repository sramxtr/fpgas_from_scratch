# fpgas_from_scratch
Learn how to program FPGAs, starting from .. relatively scratch

The current plan is to have the following tutorials:
- Intro to FPGAs, use Vivado to blink an LED
- Verilog/SystemVerilog tutorial, develop a debouncer and an FSM
- HW/SW co-design using the Zynq: blink a LED from the ARM PS
- Acceleration example: count unique values
